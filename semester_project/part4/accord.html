      <h3>What JavaScript can do for you</h3>
      <div>
        <ul>
          <li>JavaScript is very easy to implement. All you need to do is put your code in the HTML document and tell the browser that it is JavaScript.</li>
          <li>JavaScript allows you to create highly responsive interfaces that improve the user experience and provide dynamic functionality, without having to wait for the server to react and show another page.</li>
          <li>JavaScript can test for what is possible in your browser and react accordingly.</li>
          <li>JavaScript can load content into the document if and when the user needs it, without reloading the entire page</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <h3>Uses of scripting</h3>
      <div>
        <p>Javascript enables scripting on the client side of a user's browser. It can be used to validate information (such as form data a user
          is filling out) to check everything is correct before sending the information to the server. This saves time by cutting out the server from needing
          to verify the data it receives.</p>
        <p>It is also used to dynamically interact with a website. It can either generate or edit content on the page based on specific actions taken by
          the user.</p>
      </div>
      <h3>Widely used</h3>
      <div>
        <p>Javascipt is very popular and fairly easy to use, thus it is in many of today's websites. Due to its popularity, many extensions have
          been developed to add it or improve features. </p>
      </div>
      <h3>Benefits</h3>
      <div>
        <ul>
          <li>Lightweight</li>
          <li>Free</li>
          <li>Minimal code</li>
          <li>Cross-browser compatible</li>
          <li>Many useful extensions, such as jQuery and its plug-ins</li>
        </ul>
