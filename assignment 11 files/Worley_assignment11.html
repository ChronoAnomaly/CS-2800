    <p>This presentations was about chapter 14 animations. The group gave detailed information for
      animations, transitions, transforms, and filters, along with the different types of properties
      that belong to the different types. Examples were provided that showed how to use the effects

    <p>Transitions are a property that can be set to trigger each time an object is changing appearance. They
      are used to set the duration, a timing function, delay, and what actually changes with an object. The timing
      function is used tell how fast a transition occurs.</p>

      on the page.</p>
    <p>Animations are used to change the location of an object. They also allow content to move moved in from outside
      of a single window, allowing more content to fit into a single page. There are a number of properties related
      to the time of the animation, direction, its name, and if it repeats.</p>
    <p>Filters allow for manipulation of an image after it has already been loaded by the browser. This type has
      a number of properties used to apply different styles to the image.</p>
