      <h3>Good Design</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Good Usability and ease of finding topics</li>
        <li>Uses a tiling system for the different stories that does not take up too much space</li>
        <li>Menu buttons and tabs are at the top of the screen for ease of moving around</li>
        <li>Simple design without too much going on within the screen space</li>
        <li>Easy to read typography and follows good graphics design</li>
        <li>Site has a similar feeling on mobile devices</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Bad Design</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Menu buttons for topics are in a different place on mobile devices, hidden in a menu tab</li>
        <li>As you go through links to different areas, the site does not show where you are exactly very well</li>
        <li>Main page is very long, have to scroll 7-9 screen lengths to reach the bottom for extra sections of the site</li>
      </ul>
